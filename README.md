Feel free to use these saves and scripts in any way you see fit, I retain no rights or license.  If you'd like to credit me I'd be grateful! https://www.youtube.com/@deighv

##Scripts:

###autoCommit.ps1 -
This will backup every autosave/manual save into a git repo.  Think of the content creation possibilities of being able to go back to any point in time of your base!  I have 2200 saves from Split River Plains in total (it's about 9gb).

###create-autoCommit.exe.ps1
Creates an executable for autoCommit if you want to run it on startup/that's easier for you.

###autoRecord.py -
(Relies on PyInput_KeyCodes.py)
Work in progress, but:

Run this script, tab over to Syx, it will:

Set your camera to a corner with a consistent zoom, then move your camera to a consistent set location of your choosing, with some tweaking, begin recording for a set amount of time, then stop recording.  Assuming we have the same shortcuts configured.  Note, Syx is picky when it comes to the keys it's okay with being macrod
